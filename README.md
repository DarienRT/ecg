## Motivation
[**Supervised learning** is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)<br><br>
This software is aiming to help the related specialists to use their knowledge to create labeled training data that can be used in supervised learning.
